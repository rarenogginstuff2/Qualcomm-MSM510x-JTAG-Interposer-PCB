This interposer PCB can be used to add JTAG to any Qualcomm MSM5100, MSM5105, MSM3100, or MSM3300 phone lacking JTAG, provided you are good with BGA rework. Also included is the actual SoC pinout (Which can be used to find JTAG test points with continuity test on a multimeter after removing the SoC) and a MSM5100 elevator PCB with the exact size as the SoC used to add clearance to the phone's SoC pads to allow room for the interposer in case there are any small components crammed around the original SoC, considering the interposer is slightly larger than the SoC. Gerber files are inside the zip files.
